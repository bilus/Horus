+ Echo
	+ Install cucumber.
	+ Generate an empty cucumber story and make it run.
	+ Cucumber doesn't work. Make a simplest possible rspec test pass through selenium.
	+ Write a rspec story to check echo functionality and make it fail.
	+ Make the echo work on Heroku and EC2.
+ Story 1
	+ Create a remote cucumber test and see if it works at all.
	+ Make cucumber start/stop thin server.
	+ Write scenario for story 1 using low-level Capybara.
	+ Make it fail.
	+ Make it pass.
		+ add_tile_action_spec
			FAIL - Create rspec compatible with cramp based on cramp/test_case.
			+ Create support for running cramp-based asyncronous server specs.
			+ Make test 'get' work.
			+ Only POST should be supported.
			+ Should add tile to the game.
		+ game_events_spec
			+ Should respond with empty story for a new game.
			+ Should respond with a story after adding tiles once.
+ Story 2 - one player starts game, adds four tiles
+ Story 3 - after playing a game, a player can start a new game.
- Tidy up a bit.	
	+ Go through T O D O and F I X M E in code.
	- Create RESTful routes and use them in JavaScript.
		+ PUT game/ --> add_tile_action
		+ GET game/ --> game_events_action
		+ Use in JS.
		+ Rename HomePageAction to HomePageAction (also the file).
		+ Rename index.haml to index.htm.haml.
		+ Make everything work.

- Story 4 - Two players can simultaneously play two separate games.
	+ Figure out how to do it.
	  Here's how: add a button on the home page to start a game. Upon clicking the button, the browser
	  calls /game with POST method and receives the ID of the new game. It then redirects to /game.htm?id=39423948 with GET which uses /game?id=39423948 via GET to receive events using EventSource.
	- Make the old cucumber tests pass with the button.
		- POST game/ --> new_game_action
		- GET game.htm --> game_page_action
	- Figure out how to write a cucumber test with two browser windows.
	- Write cucumber test and see it fail.
