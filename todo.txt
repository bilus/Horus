			+ Should add tile to the game.
		+ game_events_spec
			+ Should respond with empty story for a new game.

- Story 4 - Two players can simultaneously play two separate games.
	+ Figure out how to do it.
	+ Figure out how to write a cucumber test with two browser windows.
	+ Write cucumber test and see it fail.
	  	 Here's how: add a button on the home page to start a game. Upon clicking the button, the browser calls /game
         with POST method and receives the ID of the new game. It then redirects to /game.htm?id=39423948 with GET which
         uses /game?id=39423948 via GET to receive events using EventSource.
		+ Write the scenario.
		- Update the cucumber steps to use the button and wait for #board when creating new game.
	- Make the old cucumber tests pass with the button.
		- POST game/ --> new_game_action
			- Use code from HomePageAction (Game.start!)
			- Render id of the new game.
		- GET game.htm --> game_page_action
			- Render the haml copied from index.html.haml
			- Use the id from the url when creating EventSource.
		- Home page
			- Visiting home page should no longer start game.
			- Add button.
			- POST game/ to obtain game ID.
			- Redirect using the returned ID.
