+ Echo
</p>
<pre>
        + Install cucumber.
        + Generate an empty cucumber story and make it run.
        + Cucumber doesn't work. Make a simplest possible rspec test pass through selenium.
        + Write a rspec story to check echo functionality and make it fail.
        + Make the echo work on Heroku and EC2.
</pre>
<p>
+ Story 1
</p>
<pre>
        + Create a remote cucumber test and see if it works at all.
        + Make cucumber start/stop thin server.
        + Write scenario for story 1 using low-level Capybara.
        + Make it fail.
        + Make it pass.
                + add_tile_action_spec
                        FAIL - Create rspec compatible with cramp based on cramp/test_case.
                        + Create support for running cramp-based asyncronous server specs.
                        + Make test 'get' work.
                        + Only POST should be supported.
                        + Should add tile to the game.
                + game_events_spec
                        + Should respond with empty story for a new game.
                        + Should respond with a story after adding tiles once.
</pre>
<p>
+ Story 2 - one player starts game, adds four tiles + Story 3 - after
playing a game, a player can start a new game. + Tidy up a bit.        
</p>
<pre>
        + Go through T O D O and F I X M E in code.
        + Create RESTful routes and use them in JavaScript.
                + PUT game/ --&gt; add_tile_action
                + GET game/ --&gt; game_events_action
                + Use in JS.
        + Rename HomePageAction to HomePageAction (also the file).
        + Rename index.haml to index.htm.haml.
        + Make everything work.
</pre>
<p>
+ Story 4 - Two players can simultaneously play two separate games.
</p>
<pre>
        + Figure out how to do it.
        + Figure out how to write a cucumber test with two browser windows.
        + Write cucumber test and see it fail.
                 Here's how: add a button on the home page to start a game. Upon clicking the button, the browser calls /game
         with POST method and receives the ID of the new game. It then redirects to /game.htm?id=39423948 with GET which
         uses /game?id=39423948 via GET to receive events using EventSource.
                + Write the scenario.
                + Update the cucumber steps to use the button and wait for #board when creating new game.
        + Make the old cucumber tests pass with the button.
                + Add button to homepage with redirect to /game.htm
                + GET game.htm --&gt; game_page_action
                        + Render the haml moved from index.html.haml            
                + See cucumber pass except for @story4.
                + Commit.
        * Let's now make the story #4 cucumber test pass.
                + When the user clicks button@new-game, it POSTs game/ to obtain the new game id
                + and redirects to game.htm?id=&lt;new game id&gt;.
                + POST game/ routes to NewGameAction.
                + The action accepts only POST requests
                + and when is invoked it starts a new game
                + and renders its unique id.
                + To make old cucumber tests pass, Application.start_new_game simply creates a new Game object and 
                  returns a dummy id.
                + All rspec specs pass. All cucumber tests pass except for @story4.
                + COMMIT.
                + Browser should pull events for the specific game so /game.htm uses the id from its url when creating
          its EventSource.
                + Write spec for GameEventsAction: it should render tiles for multiple games based on their id.
                + When user adds a tile it should be POSTed using the current game id
                + and added to the correct game.
                + Add application_spec 
                        + when asked for a new game it should query the game class (Game.create) and return Game::id.
                        + and also find_game method should be a simple mapping to Game.find(id).
                        + The test method clear! is no longer necessary.
                + Game.create
                        * should return a new Game object.
                        * should create Games with different ids (note: use guids).
                + Game.find
                        * should find Game objects based on id.
                + I extracted the JavaScript Horus API into a separate file (horus_api.js).
                + All cucumber and rspec tests pass.
                + COMMIT.
</pre>
<p>
+ Story 5 - Players can join games in progress.
</p>
<pre>
        + The main page now lists all current games as links 
        + so I changed the title of new-game#button to &quot;Start new game&quot; to make it more consistent.
        + All rspec &amp; cucumber tests pass.
        + COMMIT.
</pre>
<p>
+ Push to ec2 and make it run there.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
Package my rspec support for cramp.
</p>
<pre>
      * Write test-first:
              * respond_with
                      * should support the GET method.
                      * should support the POST method.
                      * should support the PUT method.
                      * should support the DELETE method.
                      * should timeout when no response.
                      * should handle exception in callback (wrapped_callback).
                      * should handle sync errors e.g. 404
                      * support passing headers to get/post etc.
                      * passing {} as the second arg when there are no options should be unnecessary
                              * rename to as respond_with
                              * rewrite so for body it's used like this respond_with :body =&gt; &quot;EUEUEU&quot;
                                      * exact match
                                      * regex match
                              * add support for code: respond_with :code =&gt; 200
                                      * number
                                      * number as string
                                      * symbol =&gt; :ok, :error
                                      * regex
                              * add support for header: respond with :header =&gt; { &quot;Last-Event-ID&quot; =&gt; &quot;234234&quot;, ... }
                                      * exact match
                                      * regex match
              * rewrite get/post so there are two usages:
                      * get &quot;/&quot; do { }
                      * get(&quot;/&quot;).should respond_with :code =&gt; :ok
      * Make them pass.
      * Refactor the code.
      * Make them pass.
      * Make specs in Horus pass.
      * Send the draft to lifo.
